## Project Description
Project uses a generative neural network to generate images from a text prompt using open source tools.
The following are the dependencies for this project:

- Stable Diffusion (diffvg)
- Gradio (UI design for testing)
- FastAPI for deployment

Below is a generation for a very general prompt, which is something that has many different interpretations:

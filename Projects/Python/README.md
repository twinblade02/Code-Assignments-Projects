# Image Editor: Intial-D

This script is basically a simple image breakdown to find edges and contours of an input image, and save them as a trace of the original image. The output is reminiscent
of the Inital-D manga and art style.

Simply put - the input image is a cropped version of the original, to reduce noise.

The output should look something like this - after editing contrast and threshold.

Program is essentially a part of a series of steps that must be done before segmenting an object within an image via thresholding.

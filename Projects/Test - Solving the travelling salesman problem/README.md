## The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This notebook goes over the more simpler method of solving the TSP using a Self-Organizing Map, or SOM.

Basically, the TSP asks the question: "Given a list of points and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that would allow each point to be visited at
least once from the source point?". 

In the notebook, we use a self organizing map (using the MiniSOM package) to find an optimal path as an answer to the TSP.

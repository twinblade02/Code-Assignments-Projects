# Case Study: Examining neighbourhoods in NYC

As the title says, this project examines web-scraped information of neighbourhoods in NYC, and combine this information with location data generated from the
Foursquare API. The business problem here is to figure out which venue type and neighbourhood would be a good start-up option.
Our goal requires us to segment our findings into clusters while retaining any information that would help us differentiate between each cluster.

    "#### Names of works of art (books, movies, video games, etc.) are quite different from the kinds of named entities we’ve discussed in the lecture. Collect a list of names of works of art from a particular category from a Web-based source (e.g., gutenberg.org, amazon.com, imdb.com, etc.). Analyze your list and give examples of ways that the names in it are likely to be problematic for the techniques described in this week's material.\n",

    "The first thing I see here that may be a problem with the names of the titles mentioned in the list. Some of the words, like \"Witcher\", \"Dota\" and \"Kombat\" either do not mean anything in the English language or are spelt incorrectly on purpose. The second is the use of roman numerals in the names of the titles, which also may be an issue when attempting to establish a classifer. Though, with most titles being related to each other, by name - that is; making a relationship set could be done. \n",
    "For named entities, we may have a problem with the tags since they are definite noun phrases and our list contains titles that mostly do not have these present. What complicates things further is also the ambiguous nature of the characters present in the list, such as the use of X in the titles \"Ace Combat X\" and \"Mortal Kombat X\" - where the former is used as an alphabetical character, and the latter is actually a Roman numeral. The presence of titles in a foreign langauge (Assetto Corsa and Gran Turismo) also causes further complications for all IE related tasks. "

Time is depicted in 24 hour format for automated emails and 12 hour format for those that are handwritten. News articles on the web are different based on where they originate from - just like those found in emails. If the article originates outside of the US, it would use temporal formats like DMY and YDM (for Japan). Time formats usually are consistent."
